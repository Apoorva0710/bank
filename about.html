      Past, present and future
Ever since the Lincoln administration signed national bank charter No. 24 in 1863, we’ve drawn on our financial strength to serve customers. This has been especially evident in times of need, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our response has included a $20 million premium pay program for our employees, numerous product modifications and 100,000+ PPP loans for our customers, and $30 million in expedited charitable contributions for our communities. As a result, we’re proud to have been named the most essential bank amid the pandemic in a ranking by The Harris Poll.

We also recognize that this past year has fundamentally changed banking by accelerating the shift to digital products and services. We’re positioned well for this future, having launched new tools – like the U.S. Bank Smart Assistant – to complement our 26-state branch footprint.

      Leadership and governance
Led by Chairman, President and CEO Andy Cecere, our company is managed by a 14-person Managing Committee. This group includes the leaders of our four core business lines – Consumer and Business Banking; Payment Services; Corporate and Commercial Banking; and Wealth Management and Investment Services – as well as the heads of functional areas including risk management, digital transformation, diversity and more.

As a publicly traded company, we’re also governed by a 13-member Board of Directors, which is chaired by Cecere. This group brings decades of expertise from a variety of industries, from healthcare to logistics and retail to tech.
